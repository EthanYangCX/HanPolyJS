HanPoly with pure react (no independent backend)

Whereby you can search Chinese characters (Unicode alias: Han) (CJKV Unified Ideographs) and some of their romanization (Middle Chinese pinyin (by `polyhedron`), pinyin, jyutping, Japanese romaji etc.)

Looking forward to your feedback.

# TODO List

- [x] Diaplay a random character from the 3500 most common list
- [ ] Highlight languages selected from a checkbox
- [ ] Transformation of different forms of characters (simplified, traditional, and other forms)
- [ ] Other ways to display, e.g. jp, kr, vn scripts, IPA
- [ ] Interprete the formatting symbols in the sqlite, like those form gray font
- [ ] Better ways to search on the romanizations
- [ ] My practice (3500 common characters first)
- [ ] Pagination
- [ ] Unify card size
